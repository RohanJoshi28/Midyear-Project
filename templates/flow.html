        <p style = "border: 2px solid lightblue; color: rgb(248, 247, 169);">The code first accesses the webcam and converts each frame into grayscale. 
            Then the frames are passed through a OpenCv face detector giving the coordinates of the face,
            and the frames are cropped to just the face. After that it is converted to tensors where it is passedthrough a pytorch
            convolutional architecture where the emotion is detected. Finally boxes labeled with the detected emotion are put onto the 
            frame and it is sent to the video display.
